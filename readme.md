Mastermind 

Description

For project 1, I have decided upon mastermind. This is a childhood pastime enjoyed by my family. However, the difference is that we always play against human opponents,
where it can sometimes be easy to look for a tell, or even hazard a guess based on the player's favorite color.

This project, would, however focus on a setting of player against computer. The most challenging portion would be setting up of the interface for the gameboard, such that
each button would cycle through 4 different colors when clicked and then reset back to the first color on the 5th click.
